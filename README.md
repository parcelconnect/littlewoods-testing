# Littlewoods ID Verification

Django-based app that allows Littlewoods customers to upload documents proving
their identity. These documents are then sent to Littlewoods.

Then they get reviewed and customers whose identity was verified get Littlewoods
credits. Whoever, this project is not responsible for that functionality.

## Instalation
